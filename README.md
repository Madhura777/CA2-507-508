# üè• Electronic Health Record (EHR) System  
*A Containerized, Monitored, and Automated Healthcare Application*

---

## üìñ Overview  
This project implements a **cloud-native Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system that securely manages patient data and appointments.  
The system is built using **Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible, and GitHub Actions**, showcasing a full DevOps lifecycle ‚Äî from CI/CD to infrastructure automation and monitoring.

---

## üöÄ Features  

- **Frontend (EHR Web UI)** ‚Äì Built with HTML/CSS/JS, accessible via NodePort service.  
- **Backend (Express.js API)** ‚Äì Handles patient and appointment data with REST APIs.  
- **Database (MongoDB)** ‚Äì Stores patient and appointment records persistently.  
- **Containerization (Docker)** ‚Äì Each component runs in isolated containers.  
- **Orchestration (Kubernetes)** ‚Äì Deploys and scales the application automatically.  
- **Automation (Ansible)** ‚Äì Automates environment setup and deployment.  
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)** ‚Äì Builds and pushes Docker images automatically.  
- **Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)** ‚Äì Collects metrics and visualizes application health.
